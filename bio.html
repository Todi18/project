<strong><h3>Background story:</h3></strong>
I was born in Nigeria and moved to the Uk (Manchester) at the age of 9. During my time in primary school and high school i was involved with a lot of sports activities.<br>
Which were athlectics, rugby, football and basketball. I even captained some of those teams.But later on in high school i deciced to play basketball. I had a goal of <br>
going to the nba. I would practice every moring before school, this is simple for me becuase the basketball centre was next to my school. But when i stared college i <br>
deciced to stop playing, mainly becuase i just didn't have the love for it anymore as i used to. I wanted to focus more on my studies instead. 
</p>

<strong><h3>Reason why chose an apprenticeship</h3></strong>
The main reason I joined Multiverse is becuase i felt like they has the right staffs for me to progress in software engineering and take my skills to the next level<br>
Also from a young age, i've always knew that i wanted to work in the IT industry, this is mainly because most businesses are now mostly operated through computers.<br>
Most businesses now commnunicate and interact with their customers/clients through zoom calls, presentations through powerpoint and so many more.
