<p> I used to work at Manchester United football stadium as front of staff.<br>
    I normally worked there on the weekends as part time job. I worked there<br>
    for 1 year and a half. During my time there, i met life time friends. The<br>
    staffs there were so nice to me. They were all easy to talk to and as a whole,<br>
    staffs there are really welcoming. To be honest i couldn't have imagined a better<br>
    first job. That's how much i loved it there!!!
